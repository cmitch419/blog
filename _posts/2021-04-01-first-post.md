I got a wild hair up my keister today and decided to do some maintenance on and upgrade my Windows 10 dev environment.

* Upgraded from WSL to [WSL2][wsl2]
* Cleaned up my old workspaces
* Set up [Remote-WSL][remote-wsl] in [Visual Studio Code][vscode]
* Set up [Ruby on Rails in WSL2][rails-wsl2]
* Set up [ROS dev environment on WSL2][ros-wsl2]
* Set up [Jekyll][jekyll] and created this GitHub page

It's been a surprisingly productive day while having little to show for it, but the goal was to lay the foundation for future projects so that I can easily switch between multiple learning streams without having to go through the slow setup process.
